##arrays are intended just to hold numeric values, they keep the values next to each other. makes calcs on entire arrays quicker than lists
#arrays can only call numeric data types
#they can be any dimension you want, arrays can hold arrays. crazy dimensional representation of the data
#makes it diff from matrix since its only a two dimensional array
